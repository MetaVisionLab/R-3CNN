# R<sup>3</sup>CNN: Regression Guided by Relative Ranking Using Convolutional Neural Network for Facial Beauty Prediction

R<sup>3</sup>CNN is a general CNN architecture to integrate the relative ranking of faces in terms of aesthetics to improve the performance of facial beauty prediction.

## Requirements
* Caffe (compiled with pycaffe)
* python
* numpy
* matplotlib
* skimage

## Installation
+ Build caffe
   ```
   make all -j16
   make test
   make pycaffe
   ```

+ Add the python directory of caffe into the environment variable
   + Open bash file:
    `sudo gedit ~/.bashrc`
   + Add the following setence into the file:
    `export PYTHONPATH=brl/caffe/python:$PYTHONPATH`
   + Update the environment variable:
   `source ~/.bashrc`
   
## Preparation
+ Dataset download: 
  
  Our method is trained and verified on [SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark dataset](https://github.com/HCIILAB/SCUT-FBP5500-Database-Release). The folder of images is renamed as 'faces', and put under './examples/data' directory, where train and test set have been already provided.

+ Image pairs generation: 
   ```
   cd examples/data/
   python create_pair.py
   ```

+ Mean file computation:
   ```
   sh mean.sh
   ```
   
## Training
+ First stage: conventional training for ResNeXt-based regression model, using pretrained model on ImageNet (download link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/12AtCeQYuYDZtUd9jZPIo1w  password: enfc):
   ```
   cd examples/first_stage
   sh train.sh
   ```

+ Second stage:
   + Rename the caffemodel obtained in the first stage as the format of 'R2Net_hinge_iter_0.caffemodel' (download link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Dx3H108gCvJ71fcVg3BzjQ  password: p3jk) ;
   + Put R2Net_hinge_iter_0.caffemodel under 'examples/hinge_loss/snapshot/1';
   + Use hinge loss to train  R<sup>3</sup>CNN:
      ```
      cd examples/hinge_loss
      sh train.sh
      ```
   + If using LSEP loss to train R<sup>3</sup>CNN, you can run 'examples/lsep_loss/train.sh'ï¼›
   + If using other backbone networks (i.e., AlexNet and ResNet-18) to train R<sup>3</sup>CNN, you can run the codes in './examples/other_networks';

## Validation
+ The trained ResNeXt-based R<sup>3</sup>CNN caffemodel is available at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1YVwKrBZS4kpNWHTRs-9qTA  password: xcx7 (1.6GB)
+ Run the testing file:
   ```
   cd examples/test_inference
   python test_forward.py 
   ```
